# Scorpion

Scorpion is a classical planning system that extends [Fast
Downward](https://www.fast-downward.org). The main extensions are:

* novel state-of-the-art algorithms for optimal classical planning
* additional search algorithms
* several new plugin options and utilities

See [below](#differences-between-scorpion-and-fast-downward) for a detailed list
of extensions. We regularly port the latest changes from Fast Downward to
Scorpion and also integrate some features from Scorpion back into Fast Downward.

## IPC 2023 version

The instructions in this document are for the Scorpion 2023 planner which
participated in the [IPC 2023](https://ipc2023-classical.github.io/). You can
find the latest Scorpion planning system at
https://github.com/jendrikseipp/scorpion.

The recommended way to run Scorpion 2023 is via the
[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) image:

    apptainer build scorpion_2023.sif Apptainer.scorpion_2023
    ./scorpion_2023.sif DOMAIN_FILE PROBLEM_FILE PLAN_FILE

In [seq_opt_scorpion_2023.py](driver/portfolios/seq_opt_scorpion_2023.py) you
can find the configurations that Scorpion 2023 uses, depending on the features
of the input task.


## Differences between Scorpion and Fast Downward

Diff between the latest merged version of Fast Downward and Scorpion:
https://github.com/jendrikseipp/scorpion/compare/main...scorpion

- Scorpion comes with the
  [h²-preprocessor](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/13708)
  by Vidal Alcázar and Álvaro Torralba that prunes irrelevant operators.
  Pass `--transform-task preprocess-h2` to use it.
- The `--transform-task` command allows you to run arbitrary preprocessing
  commands that transform the SAS+ output from the translator before
  passing it to the search.
- Scorpion uses a
  [phmap::flat_hash_set](https://github.com/greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap) to check
  for duplicate states, which often drastically reduces the peak memory usage,
  compared to Fast Downward's `IntHashSet`.
- If [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) is installed (recommended), Scorpion
  uses it to cache compilation files.

### New translator options

- Use `--dump-predicates` and `--dump-static-atoms` to write files with
  information that's useful for learning domain control knowledge.


### New plugin options

- `{cegar/cartesian}(..., search_strategy=incremental)`: use [incremental search for
  Cartesian abstraction
  refinement](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/6667)
  (default).

- `{cegar/cartesian}(..., pick_flawed_abstract_state={batch_min_h, ...})`:
  find all current flaws, then iteratively repair the flaw that's closest to the goal
  ([paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/19819), default=`batch_min_h`).

- `{cegar/cartesian}(..., pick_split={max_cover, ...}, tiebreak_split={max_refined, ...})`:
  smarter strategies for splitting a flawed abstract state
  ([paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/19819), default=`max_cover`
  and `max_refined` for tiebreaking).

- `{cegar,cartesian}(..., dot_graph_verbosity={silent, write_to_console, write_to_file})`:
  write intermediate abstractions as Graphviz dot files to stdout or to files (default=`silent`).

- `hillclimbing(..., max_generated_patterns=200)`: limit the number of
  patterns generated by hill climbing.

- `systematic(..., pattern_type=interesting_general)`: compute interesting
  patterns for general cost partitioning.


### New cost partitioning algorithms for abstraction heuristics

We use Cartesian abstractions in the example configurations below
(`[cartesian()]`). You can also use pattern database heuristics, e.g.,
`[projections(systematic(2))]`, or mix abstractions, e.g.,
`[projections(systematic(3)), cartesian()]`. Some of the algorithms below
are also part of vanilla Fast Downward, but are only implemented for PDB
heuristics.

- Optimal cost partitioning:
  `ocp([cartesian()])`
- Canonical heuristic:
  `canonical_heuristic([cartesian()])`
- Uniform cost partitioning:
  `ucp([cartesian()], opportunistic=false)`
- Opportunistic uniform cost partitioning:
  `ucp([cartesian()], ..., opportunistic=true)`
- Greedy zero-one cost partitioning:
  `gzocp([cartesian()], ...)`
- Saturated cost partitioning:
  `scp([cartesian()], ...)` (offline), `scp_online([cartesian()], ...)` (online)
- (Saturated) post-hoc optimization:
  `pho([cartesian()], ..., saturated={false,true})` (offline),
  `operatorcounting([pho_abstraction_constraints([cartesian()], saturated={false,true})])` (online)

You can also compute the maximum over abstraction heuristics:

- `maximize([cartesian()])`

The plugin documentation shows all options for [cost partitioning
heuristics](https://jendrikseipp.github.io/scorpion/Evaluator/#cost_partitioning_heuristics).

## New pattern collection generators

- Systematic patterns with size limits:
  `sys_scp(max_pattern_size=X, max_pdb_size=Y, max_collection_size=Z, ..., saturate=false)`
- Sys-SCP patterns:
  `sys_scp(...)`


### New cost partitioning algorithms for landmark heuristics

Example using A* search and saturated cost partitioning over BJOLP
landmarks:

    --evaluator
      "lmc=lmcount(lm_merged([lm_rhw(), lm_hm(m=1)]),
      admissible=true, cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=true,
      reuse_costs=true, scoring_function=max_heuristic_per_stolen_costs)"
    --search
      "astar(lmc, lazy_evaluator=lmc)"

Different cost partitioning algorithms (all need `admissible=true`):

- Optimal cost partitioning (part of vanilla Fast Downward):
  `lmcount(..., cost_partitioning=optimal)`
- Canonical heuristic:
  `lmcount(..., cost_partitioning=canonical)`
- Post-hoc optimization:
  `lmcount(..., cost_partitioning=pho)`
- Uniform cost partitioning:
  `lmcount(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=false, reuse_costs=false)`
- Opportunistic uniform cost partitioning (part of vanilla Fast Downward):
  `lmcount(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=false, reuse_costs=true, scoring_function=min_stolen_costs)`
- Greedy zero-one cost partitioning:
  `lmcount(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=true, reuse_costs=false, scoring_function=max_heuristic)`
- Saturated cost partitioning:
  `lmcount(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=true, reuse_costs=true, scoring_function=max_heuristic_per_stolen_costs)`


## New search engines

- Breadth-first search (without overhead of the more general `eager()` search):
  `brfs()`
- Depth-first search:
  `dfs()`
- Exhaustive search (useful for dumping the reachable state space of small input tasks):
  `dump_reachable_search_space()`
- IDA* search:
  `idastar(cegar(cache_estimates=false))`
- Iterative width search:
  `iw(width=2)`

## History

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

- the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert
  and Silvia Richter
- LAMA, developed by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal based on
  the original Fast Downward
- FD-Tech, a modified version of Fast Downward developed by Erez
  Karpas and Michael Katz based on the original code

In addition to these three main sources, the codebase incorporates
code and features from numerous branches of the Fast Downward codebase
developed for various research papers. The main contributors to these
branches are Malte Helmert, Gabi Röger and Silvia Richter.
